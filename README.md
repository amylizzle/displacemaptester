# how to use
You need to grab these dependencies:
```
pip install gradio pyopengl glfw
```

then just run 
```
python3 main.py
```
connect to the address and futz with the shader code until something nice pops out.
Download the displacement map with the button in the top right, and use it in BYOND or OpenDream to make lovely visual effects.
For animated displacement maps, set the frames slider to more than 1 and click the "Download Spritesheet" button to get a spritesheet you can import directly to Dream Maker.
